First run:
Run `create_log_db.py` once. (You may have to edit out comment hash signs)

Testing Your Connection:
When you suspect an internet connection problem or outage, run `log_ic_manually.py`. Keep running it until you're connected to the internet again. 
Note: It's made to only make a new log every 30 seconds, but you can change this treshold to your liking in the script.
Warning: Running this script many times a second, for a prolonged period, may result in you getting banned from the servers it is pinging for attempted DDOS.

Print Log:
When you want to view the log, run `print_log.py`. It'll format the entries into something human readable. Then just copy it, paste it into a mail, and send to your ISP with a demand for a refund. :D
