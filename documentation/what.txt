small project to check internet connection outages

reports either connected (1) or not connected (0)

stores the timestamp of when a not connected was recorded, and for how long, (including the error message) in a SQLite file

the automated version checks once or twice a minute
the manual version has simple flood controls to prevent the database from flooding over
